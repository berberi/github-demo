# github-demo

A small demo React app that lists public GitHub repositories. Mainly exists as an excuse to play around with interacting with an AWS Lambda function through AWS API Gateway, which acts as a layer of abstraction on top of the GitHub API requests for the app. The Lambda function implementation can be found in the [github-lambda-proxy](https://github.com/berberi/github-lambda-proxy) repo.

Initial react app generated with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
